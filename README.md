# simple-blinking-animation

A fork of [this mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3529626689). Changes from the original:

- Do less work in the pawn component tick
- Do less work in the pawn renderer
- Textures 4x upscaled using [Upscayl](https://github.com/upscayl/upscayl) (not perfect but good enough)
